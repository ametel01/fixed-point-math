# ONNX-Cairo Runtime

ONNX-Cairo Runtime is a Cairo library that provides two high-level features:

* Tensor computation (like Numpy) in Cairo 1.0.
* Verifiable Machine Learning models using STARKS.

### ü§î What is ONNX Runtime inference?

ONNX Runtime is an open-source, high-performance inference engine for machine learning models in the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. ONNX is an interoperable format that allows deep learning models to be represented, shared, and executed across different AI frameworks and platforms.

ONNX Runtime inference can enable faster user experiences and lower costs, supporting models from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras as well as classical machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, etc. ONNX Runtime is compatible with various hardware, drivers, and operating systems, and provides optimal performance by leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable alongside graph optimizations and transforms.

This library proposes a new ONNX runtime built with [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/). The purpose is to provide a runtime implementation for verifiable ML model inferences using [STARKs](https://starkware.co/stark/).

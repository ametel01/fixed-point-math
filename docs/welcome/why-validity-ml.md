# Why Validity ML?

"The deployment of machine learning (ML) is becoming more intricate. Numerous enterprises are now opting for ML-as-a-service providers (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, among others) to implement complicated, proprietary ML models. With the proliferation of these services, they become progressively more challenging to audit and understand, posing a vital question: how can consumers of these services trust the validity of the predictions provided?

ZKML offers a solution by enabling the validation of private data using public models or verifying private models with public data."
